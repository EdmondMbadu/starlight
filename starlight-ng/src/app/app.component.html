          <h3 class="about-h1">This started as class project. Initially we thought about doing a simulation, but our friend Steff was big
            Into writing and we decided to dedicate the site to her and ourselves to write on our stories. </h3>

            We believe in the power of community and collaboration, and we encourage you to engage 
            with us and share your thoughts and ideas. Our goal is to create a space where anyone can connect,
