                Words are of no use <br>
                It is not the way nature expresses itself <br>  
                Nature expresses itself through different means <br>
                Words are for humans who wants to be overly specific <br>
                Nature understands and hence can do the same thing in infinitely different ways <br>
                Humans are cursed through words ... <br>
